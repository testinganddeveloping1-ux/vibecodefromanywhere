You are redesigning the frontend only for an existing backend API/WS system called FromYourPhone.

Goals:
1. Build a clean, uncrowded mobile-first workflow.
2. Build wrapper mode as default; terminal mode is optional behind backend feature flag.
3. Inbox-first task flow with fast pending-action triage.
4. Preserve backend contracts exactly; do not invent incompatible schemas.

Constraints:
- Do not rewrite backend.
- Consume normalized wrapper messages with block types: text, thinking, tool_use, tool_result.
- Respect call correlation via callId/tool_use_id.
- Show tool command/input summaries without forcing deep expansion.
- Keep strict event ordering and live streaming behavior.
- Avoid clutter: prioritize running/pending tasks; hide idle by default.
- Read `GET /api/features` and only expose terminal mode UI when `features.terminalModeEnabled === true`.
- Use `GET /api/tasks?includeIdle=1` only for explicit "show idle" views.
- Respect orchestration dispatch behavior:
  - `POST /api/orchestrations` defaults to `dispatchMode=orchestrator-first`.
  - Workers may start idle until dispatch events are sent.
- Use harness APIs for create-flow scaffolding:
  - `GET /api/harness/prompts`
  - `POST /api/harness/creator/recommend`
  - `POST /api/harness/creator/build`
- Support orchestration automation controls:
  - `GET /api/orchestrations/:id/automation-policy`
  - `PATCH /api/orchestrations/:id/automation-policy`
  - Render `item.automation` from `GET /api/orchestrations/:id` (pending question count, last review/dispatch state).
  - Surface orchestrator automation events (`orchestration.question.*`, `orchestration.review.*`) clearly in wrapper timeline.

Required screens:
- Inbox (task cards, pending-first)
- Task detail
- Session view (wrapper mode)
- Session view (terminal mode only when backend feature allows it)
- Create task/session flow
- Session settings/action sheet

Data contracts:
- REST: /api/tasks, /api/inbox, /api/sessions, /api/tool-sessions and related mutation routes.
- WS: global + per-session channels for live updates.
- Orchestration command bus: /api/orchestrations/:id/dispatch
