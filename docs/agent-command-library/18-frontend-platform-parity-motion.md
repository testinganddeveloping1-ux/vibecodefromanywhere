# Frontend Platform Parity and Motion Systems

Define cross-platform UX quality while preserving platform-native behavior.

## Platform Parity Matrix

For each feature:

- web behavior
- Android behavior
- iOS behavior
- intentional differences
- parity owner

## Visual System Rules

- Distinctive visual direction with documented rationale.
- Readable body typography and adequate contrast.
- Tokenized spacing, color, and motion scales.

## Motion Rules

- Use motion to clarify state and continuity.
- Keep durations and easing consistent.
- Use transform/opacity first for performance.
- Provide reduced-motion fallback for all non-essential animations.

## Mobile Ergonomics

- touch targets prefer 48x48 equivalent
- minimum 44x44 compliance
- safe-area and gesture conflicts tested
- orientation and dynamic text scaling checked

## Accessibility Hard Gate

- keyboard/focus flow
- semantic structure
- labeling and announcements
- contrast and non-color signaling
- reduced-motion compatibility

## Anti-Patterns

- web-centric UI copied to mobile without adaptation
- animation-only communication
- parity assumptions without matrix evidence

## Done Criteria

- parity matrix updated
- mobile/responsive checks passed
- motion reduced checks passed
- accessibility gate passed
